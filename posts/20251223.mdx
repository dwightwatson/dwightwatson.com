# headerSearchBarOptions in Expo

One really cool (but seemingly lesser known) features of React Navigation is the `headerSearchBarOptions` configuration. It gives you a native search bar in the app header in only a few lines of code. It’s even better now in Expo SDK 54 because on devices running iOS 26 will get the native Liquid Glass search bar for free.

Simply set the `headerSearchBarOptions` on your screen. You can then set the search query straight on to the current path.

```js
import { useRouter } from "expo-router";

export default function Layout() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <Stack>
      <Stack.Screen
        name="index"
         options={{
          title: "Home",

          headerSearchBarOptions: {
            placeholder: "What are you looking for?",
      onChangeText: (event) => {
            router.setParams({ query: event.nativeEvent.text });
          }}
        }}
     />
   </Stack>
  );
}
```

Then you can access the query string from your component.

```
import { useLocalSearchParams } from "expo-router";

export default function Home() {
  const { query } = useLocalSearchParams<{ query: string }>();

  return <Text>{query}</Text>;
}
